Agenda

- :ref:`http-server` - We will create an application which listens to HTTP requests and
  responds to them.

- :ref:`json` - We will make our endpoints return JSON, explore
  how to do routing and learn about type embedding.

- :ref:`io`  - We will persist and read our data from disk and we'll cover sorting
  data.

- :ref:`command-line` - We will create a new program leveraging the code we've made so
  far to make a command line interface. This will involve us restructuring our
  project to support multiple binaries

- :ref:`time` - We will schedule some activities that happen at different times
  depending on user input.
